Design files for the LM project
First Version of the LM Hardware

This hardware is part of a neuroprosthesis aimed at restoring hand function in people with tetraplegia.
It is a two channel emg amplifier and a two channel functional electrical stimulator controlled by the ADUCM360 microcontroller.
These are realized using the Eagle version 7 and produced and assembled by EuroCircuits.
The circuits are tested and functional with some minor bug fixes. 



This part of the LM project has been supported by  The Italian Ministry of Health - Ricerca Corrente, the Promobilia Foundation (Sweden) grant no 16066
